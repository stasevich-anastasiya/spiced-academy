"""Far, far away, in an hardly accessible landscape, the mighty Data Medal lies hidden. Will you find the Medal and unlock the Power of Data Analytics?

    * the medal can be found on a lonely clearing
    * to unlock the medal, you need a magic spell
    * the spell is only known to a mage
    * the mage lives in a tower behind the forest
    * in the forest lives a bear that doesnâ€™t let anyone pass
    * the bear, however, loves honey. Fortunately there is a beekeeper nearby.
